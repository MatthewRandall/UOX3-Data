This is the read me and disclaimer....

this is the NPC.dfn's rewrote to use the LBR animations the critters that havent been released yet were just guessed apon and will need some tweaking for your own shard or to make OSI style as they are revealed to use

the loot and gold also will need tweaking to OSI as i find out mroe about them/osi releases the critters

The humans and venders WERENOT rewrote in this version but will be in future versions i promise!

Thanks,
