Version 1.0 -

	This world file is designed to be used as a base
	that anyone can pick up and use.  It has all towns
	including T2A completed with doors and signs only.

	There are no NPC's to get in the way or cause you
	problems.  This world file will make a great
	starter world file for all users to have.

	Keep in mind, this is only doors and signs, no
	other items to clutter your world.
